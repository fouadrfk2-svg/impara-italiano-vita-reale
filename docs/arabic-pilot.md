# Arabic interface and first two A1 units

Arabic (العربية) is available from the welcome screen and language selector.
The partial Arabic course covers all eight lessons and both assessments in
units **a1-u01** and **a1-u02**, including their unit titles and descriptions.
All other course and supporting content continues to use English fallback.

## Partial course contract

- I18n.contentLanguage("ar") remains "en". The complete English overlay is
  reapplied before Arabic, including after switching from another language.
- I18n.courseOverrides("ar") declares a1-01.js with exactly twelve entries:
  eight lesson entries, two lesson-form unit tests and two unit summaries.
  Registry loads only declared Arabic files, after English; failed files are
  retryable. No Arabic file is requested for untranslated levels.
- Lessons and assessments are atomic. Missing keys, incorrect types, empty
  theory or short indexed arrays make the entire entry fall back to English.
  Arabic-specific theory may use its own explanatory structure.
- Unit summaries are independently atomic: title and grammarNote must both
  match the English entry's shape. A missing summary cannot partially override
  the header or prevent a complete Arabic lesson from loading.
- Undeclared units and lessons cannot override the English baseline. Readings,
  references, conversations and other content families keep their baseline.
- scripts/parity.mjs checks every declared file, key, type and indexed array
  against Polish, then checks the effective course. Existing full-language
  requirements remain intact; unit entries receive the same complete shape
  check as other entries, without a lesson-only theory requirement.
- The first unit test has four article-choice nouns. All five full-language
  overlays explicitly retain four empty glossary strings. This corrects their
  old three-slot sparse placeholder and clears Arabic glosses on switching back,
  without changing their wording, Italian nouns or answer keys.
- Missing interface keys use English fallback. Native Arabic plural entries
  require all six CLDR categories. English fallback plurals use English rules.
- scripts/validate.mjs ar validates the merged course using existing rules.
  Canonical Italian, IDs, recordings, option order, grading and lesson order
  are unchanged. Untranslated toBase exercises still expect English answers.

## Language quality

Arabic uses clear Modern Standard Arabic, with explanations adapted to Arabic
speakers rather than English-specific contrasts. Translations follow the actual
Italian neutral layer where English glosses have different names, cities or
nationalities: Kasia, Gdańsk, Kraków and Polish nationality remain those examples.

The existing Italian dialogue answer "Sono dalla Polonia" is retained because
Italian choices and grading are outside the translation scope. Arabic theory
teaches the natural country-origin expression "Vengo dalla Polonia". Nothing in
this pilot changes that inherited accepted choice.

## Direction and learner state

Arabic explanations, meanings, prompts and feedback are RTL. Italian sentences,
choices, conjugations, token banks, recordings and answer inputs remain LTR.
Inline Italian in Arabic prose uses isolated bdi elements where HTML is supported.
Grammar cell direction follows its actual text; mixed cells isolate Italian.
Matching may pair Italian with Arabic meanings or Italian feminine forms, so
the right column follows its actual language rather than an Arabic assumption.
Dynamic dialogue turns retain Italian LTR choices and the actual explanation
language. Untranslated lessons retain English LTR explanations.

Progress stays under linguai.italiano.v2, schema 2. IDs, scores, review schedules,
Italian card keys and drafts keep their existing contract. Arabic glosses are
stored under tr.ar, never over tr.en. Unit declarations do not enter vocabulary
lookup as lesson IDs. Language switching preserves recorded learning progress.
As before, switching languages redraws the view: unsent exercise inputs are not
a saved attempt, so finish an answer before changing language.

## Verification

- npm test
- npm run lint
- npm run parity
- node scripts/validate.mjs ar (also pl/en/es/fr/de)
- npm run check:precache and npm run check:swversion
- npm run test:dom
- npm run test:mutations and node scripts/coverage.mjs --min 99

Focused tests verify all 68 new exercise mappings, complete text, unit metadata,
unchanged neutral Italian/answers, atomic failure, Arabic-English-Arabic and
all existing language restoration, gloss storage and learner state. Browser
tests exercise all new lessons and assessments at 1440px and 390px, including
wrong feedback, fresh retry, successful completion, reload, Italian recordings,
keyboard controls, RTL/LTR, horizontal overflow and axe AA checks.

Run CPU-heavy gates before browser verification. Prior 30-second first-lesson
timeouts occurred near final reload/language switching while mutation checks ran
concurrently; the unchanged cases passed repeated isolated runs. Preserve their
assertions and inspect traces rather than masking failures with arbitrary sleeps.

Refresh the existing shell fingerprint with
node scripts/check_swversion.mjs --napraw after cached files change.
No runtime dependency, account/database, licensing, attribution or deployment
change is involved.
